# Advanced-Topics-in-Artificial-Intelligence-Project
This repository contains an implementation of the OCTSVM model, as proposed in the paper "Robust Optimal Classification Trees Under Noisy Labels" (Blanco et al. 2020). This project was done as part of my Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence class. I was tasked with presenting this paper and reproducing its experimental results. In that context, I coded the described mathematical program of the model, using the Gurobi library and performed the experiments replicating the paper's setup. It also contains a report and a presentation analyzing the model and demonstrating the results of my reproduction.

For the comparison models, I used the OCT implementation in https://github.com/LucasBoTang/Optimal_Classification_Trees and the scikit-learn implementation of the CART algorithm.

To run the code, please install the dependencies in requirements.txt and execute the _run.py_ script.

The report was made as a IEEE Conference publication. You can view more details about the project in the corresponding PDFs.
