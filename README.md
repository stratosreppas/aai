# Advanced-Topics-in-Artificial-Intelligence-Project
This repository contains the code as well as the report from the project I am doing in the context of the Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence class. I am tasked with presenting the paper "Robust Optimal Classification Trees Under Noisy Labels" (Blanco et al. 2020) and reproducing its experimental results. In that context, I coded the described mathematical program of the model, using the Gurobi library. The project is still ongoing.
