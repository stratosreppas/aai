# Advanced-Topics-in-Artificial-Intelligence-Project
This repository contains the code as well as the report from the project I am doing in the context of the Advanced Topics in Artificial Intelligence class. I was tasked with presenting the paper "Robust Optimal Classification Trees Under Noisy Labels" (Blanco et al. 2020) and reproducing its experimental results. In that context, I coded the described mathematical program of the model, using the Gurobi library and performed the exporiments replicating the paper's setup. 

The report was made as a IEEE Conference publication. You can view more details about the project in the corresponding PDFs.
